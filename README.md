# 🕹️ Code of Eternity

**Code of Eternity** is a Python-based text adventure game where you step into the role of **Byte**, exploring digital realms, solving puzzles, and facing guardians while learning the fundamentals of computer science.
Built with a mix of storytelling, logic, and programming-inspired challenges, it’s designed to be both **fun and educational**.

---

## ✨ Features

* **🌍 Realm Exploration**: Travel through 5 unique realms including *Scriptoria Central*, *Recursive Realm*, *Binary Battlegrounds*, and *Variable Valleys*.
* **⚔️ Guardian Challenges**: Solve puzzles inspired by **logic gates, recursion, riddles, and code deciphering** to progress.
* **🎒 Dynamic Game State**: Track inventory, health, quests, and achievements.
* **🎵 Immersion**: Background music and sound effects (via `pygame`) for an engaging retro feel.
* **📖 Storytelling**: Handcrafted dialogues, puzzles, and lore around computer science concepts.

👉 Once you upload this, it’ll look **professional and polished** to anyone visiting your repo.

Would you like me to also make you a **shorter version of README.md** (just 2–3 sections) so you can choose between a **professional detailed one** and a **minimal sleek one** depending on the audience?
