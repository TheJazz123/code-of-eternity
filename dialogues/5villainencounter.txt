Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts as a figure emerges from distorted code.

Algo: Byte, be on guard! This minion serves a powerful master.

Corrupted Minion: Little Byte, you think you can defy me? The realm will bow to my will.

Byte is suddenly encased in a shimmering Compression Cocoon.

Algo: You've been trapped! Break free, or you'll be compressed into oblivion!

Corrupted Code: Solve the locks, or become digital dust.

Algo: The cocoon is sealed by logic gates. Solve them to escape.

The interface shows three gates: an AND, an OR, and a NOT.
