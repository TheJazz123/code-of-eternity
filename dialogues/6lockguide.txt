Algo: The AND Gate unlocks only if both inputs are ON (1). 
The OR Gate unlocks if at least one input is ON (1). 
The NOT Gate inverts the input, turning ON (1) to OFF (0) and vice versa.

The output of the AND Gate is used as an input for the OR Gate. 
Your goal is to adjust the switches so that the final output after the NOT Gate is ON (1).
