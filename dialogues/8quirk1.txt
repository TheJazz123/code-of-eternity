???: Ah, a new visitor! Welcome!

Quirk: I am Quirk, keeper of coding flora. What brings you here?

Byte explains.

Quirk: I know where the key is, but what do I get?

Byte: I will find it myself.

Quirk: WAIT! I need help. A mechabot guards a tome near the ponds. Could you get it?

Byte: What is a mechabot?

Quirk: Zeref, once our master, is corrupted. Mechabots collect data for him. Help me, please?

Byte: What do I get?

Quirk: Fine! 500 coins. There is also a teleport crystal nearby. Find and use it.

Byte: Deal.
